`webpack-flow` does not install any build dependencies for you, it's just a way to manage shareable webpack configs and make them reusable.

## Install

```bash
# yarn add webpack-flow --dev
$ npm install -D webpack-flow
```

## Usage

```js
// your webpack.config.js
const flow, {
  entry, output, extensions, babel //...
} = require('webpack-flow')

module.exports = flow(
  entry('./src/index.js'),
  output('./dist/bundle.js'),
  extensions: ['', '.js'],
  babel({
    presets: ['es2015']
  })
)
```
